Question 1:
My considerations when creating the test data are:
1. All 10 users have rated movie 1, 7 of them rated movie 2, 6 of them rated movie 3.
2. Only 4 users rated both movie 2 and movie 3.
3. Average rating of the third one is higher than the first, and the second is lowest.

Question 2:
Yes. One feature from the real data is that both user id and movie id are not consecutive integers.
The second feature is that the data is not in particular order.

Question 3:
Yes. Assume that user_thresh is 5, so I donâ€™t need to calculate the similarity between movie 2 and 3.
Just manually calculate the similarity between (movie 1, movie 2) and (movie 1, movie 3).

My program has 5 functions:
The first one is to preprocess data, generate movie list and dictionaries of ratings for each movie.
The second one is to calculate the similarity of two movies.
The third one is to calculate the similarity for all movie pairs.
The fourth one is to generate output result.
The last one is the main function of whole program.
