The target of this class is to compute some parameters of a airfoil by panel point data and 
pressure coefficient data. Specifically, we want to calculate the chord length, the lift coefficient 
and stagnation point under different degree of attack.

To deal with this problem, I divide the whole process into several abstract parts, 
design method for each part, and store some results in the class as internal data 
which can be used later, this is called abstraction and encapsulation.

The init method as a main function taking all the steps below.
1. Load the coordinate and pressure coefficient data.
    Input directory and return xy and cp data
    At this part, I write error messages to check 3 types of errors.
    a) the input directory is invalid, which defined by os.path.isdir(inputdir) is False
    b) xy or cp data not found in the directory, which defined by list from glob.glob() is empty
    c) error in reading file, which defined by having trouble when ‘try:’ open(file)
2. Compute the chord length by coordinate data.
    Input xy data and return chord
3. Do pressure coefficient decomposition for each panel, then calculate total Cartesian force
coefficients by sum them up.
    Input cp data and return sum(cx) and sum(cy)
4. Compute lift coefficient by  total Cartesian force coefficients.
    Input cx, cy and alpha data, return cl 
5. Find stagnation point.
    In put xy and cp data, return list contained coordinate and cp of a stagnation point
6. The last __repr__ method is to build a string of summary of the result.
